      <section>

    
<p>I'm a PhD Candidate at the Economics Department of European University Institute in Florence, Italy. I'm interested in taxation and dynamic contract theory. I blog [in Polish] about academic economics at <a href="http://hummuseconomicus.pl/author/pdoligalski/">Hummus Œconomicus</a>.</p>

<p>I'm a job market candidate this year (2015/2016).</p>

<b>Income Taxation and Dual Labor Markets</b> [<u>job market paper</u>]

<p>
<a style="cursor:pointer;" onclick="return toggleMe('abstract-dual-labor-markets')">[abstract]</a>
<div id="abstract-dual-labor-markets" style="display:none;">
I study the optimal income taxation when two types of employment contract are available: permanent and fixed-term. I show that the permanent contracts facilitate provision of insurance to workers, while the fixed-term contracts allow for more redistribution. When the government wants to redistribute to the less productive workers, the dual labor market may be optimal. Poorer agents use the fixed-term contracts and are partially insured by the government. On the other hand, the richer types enjoy full insurance of the permanent contracts, but pay much higher taxes. I back the model with findings from the administrative dataset of employment spells from Italy.</div>

<b>Optimal Redistribution with a Shadow Economy</b> [joint with Luis Rojas]
<p>
<a style="cursor:pointer;" onclick="return toggleMe('abstract-shadow-economy')">[abstract]</a>
<div id="abstract-shadow-economy" style="display:none;">
We examine the constrained efficient allocations in the Mirrlees (1971) model with a shadow economy. There are two labor markets: formal and informal. The income from the formal market is observed by the planner, while the income from the informal market is not. There is a distribution of workers that differ with respect to the formal and the informal productivity. We show that when the planner does not observe individual productivities some workers may optimally work in the shadow economy. Moreover, the social welfare of the model with the shadow economy can be higher than the welfare of the model without the informal sector. These results hold even when each agent is more productive formally than in the shadow economy. In order to apply our theory, we propose a novel way of estimating workers’ productivities in the two sectors from micro data. Calibrating the model to Colombia, where 58% of workers are employed informally, we find that the optimal shadow economy is half that size. The optimal income tax schedule is very different then the one implied by the Mirrlees (1971) model without the informal sector.
