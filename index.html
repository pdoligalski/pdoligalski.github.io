<p>I'm a PhD Candidate from the European University Institute. I'm working on optimal taxation. Check my research below.</p>

<b>Heterogenous Labor Contracts and Income Taxation</b> [job market paper]

<b>Optimal Redistribution with a Shadow Economy</b> [joint with Luis E. Rojas]
<p>[paper] [slides]</p>

<small>We examine the constrained efficient allocations in the Mirrlees (1971) model with a shadow economy. There are two labor markets: formal and informal. The income from the formal market is observed by the planner, while the income from the informal market is not. There is a distribution of workers that differ with respect to the formal and the informal productivity. We show that when the planner does not observe individual productivities some workers may optimally work in the shadow economy. Moreover, the social welfare of the model with the shadow economy can be higher than the welfare of the model without the informal sector. These results hold even when each agent is more productive formally than in the shadow economy. In order to apply our theory, we propose a novel way of estimating workers’ productivities in the two sectors from micro data. Calibrating the model to Colombia, where 58% of workers are employed informally, we find that the optimal shadow economy is half that size. The optimal income tax schedule is very different then the one implied by the Mirrlees (1971) model without the informal sector.</small>
