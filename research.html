<b>Income Taxation and Dual Labor Markets</b> [<u>job market paper</u>]

<p>
<a style="cursor:pointer;" onclick="return toggleMe('abstract-dual-labor-markets')">[abstract]</a>
<div id="abstract-dual-labor-markets" style="display:none;">
I study the optimal income taxation when two types of employment contract are available: permanent and fixed-term. I show that the permanent contracts facilitate provision of insurance to workers, while the fixed-term contracts allow for more redistribution. When the government wants to redistribute to the less productive workers, the dual labor market may be optimal. Poorer agents use the fixed-term contracts and are partially insured by the government. On the other hand, the richer types enjoy full insurance of the permanent contracts, but pay much higher taxes. I back the model with findings from the administrative dataset of employment spells from Italy.</div>

<b>Optimal Redistribution with a Shadow Economy</b> [with Luis E. Rojas]
<p>
<a style="cursor:pointer;" onclick="return toggleMe('abstract-shadow-economy')">[abstract]</a>
<div id="abstract-shadow-economy" style="display:none;">
We examine the constrained efficient allocations in the Mirrlees (1971) model with a shadow economy. There are two labor markets: formal and informal. The income from the formal market is observed by the planner, while the income from the informal market is not. There is a distribution of workers that differ with respect to the formal and the informal productivity. We show that when the planner does not observe individual productivities some workers may optimally work in the shadow economy. Moreover, the social welfare of the model with the shadow economy can be higher than the welfare of the model without the informal sector. These results hold even when each agent is more productive formally than in the shadow economy. In order to apply our theory, we propose a novel way of estimating workers’ productivities in the two sectors from micro data. Calibrating the model to Colombia, where 58% of workers are employed informally, we find that the optimal shadow economy is half that size. The optimal income tax schedule is very different then the one implied by the Mirrlees (1971) model without the informal sector.

<b>Hedging with Human Capital in Venture Capital Contracts</b> [a bit sketchy]

<div id="abstract-hedging-with-human-capital" style="display:none;">
The aim of this paper is to identify a new role for the provision of insurance in the principal - agent framework, when the principal wants the agent to engage in some risky, yet potentially profitable, activity. When the agent’s preferences exhibit decreasing absolute risk aversion, the principal may provide some risk-free income in order to decrease risk aversion of the agent and reduce the cost of incentives. In other words, more insurance makes it easier to persuade the agent to perform a risky action. This idea is ap- plied to the case of an entrepreneur obtaining financing from a venture capital fund. Hall and Woodward (2009) show that a certainty equivalent of monetary payoffs to entrepreneurs in such contracts is close to 0. However, there is empirical evidence that entrepreneurs gain also in terms of higher future reemployment wages. This paper discusses the moral hazard problem in which the entrepreneur can divert resources pro- vided to the venture by the investor by accumulating a personal human capital. When the entrepreneur’s preferences exhibit decreasing absolute risk aversion, the investor may allow for the human capital accu- mulation in order to strategically control the risk aversion of the agent and reduce the cost of providing incentives. The human capital accumulation due to this incentive reason is likely, when the entrepreneur’s human capital is valuable and initially scarce.
