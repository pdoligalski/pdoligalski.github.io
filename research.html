<b>Redistribution with Performance Pay</b>

  Half of the jobs in the U.S. feature pay-for-performance. We study nonlinear income taxation in a model where such labor contracts arise as a result of moral hazard frictions within firms. We derive novel formulas for the incidence of arbitrarily nonlinear reforms of a given tax code on both average earnings and their sensitivity to output risk. We show theoretically and quantitatively that, following an increase in tax progressivity, the higher sensitivity of earnings to performance caused by the crowding-out of private insurance is almost fully offset by a countervailing performance-pay effect driven by labor supply responses. As a result, earnings risk is hardly affected by policy. We then turn to the normative analysis of a government that levies taxes and transfers to redistribute income across workers with different levels of uninsurable productivity. We find that setting taxes without accounting for the endogeneity of private insurance is close to optimal. Thus, the common concern that standard models of taxation underestimate the cost of redistribution is, in the context of performance-based compensation, overblown.

We extend the theory of optimal redistributive taxation to economies with an informal sector. Crucially, we allow for moonlighting - a situation when a worker has a formal main job and an informal secondary job. The optimal tax formula contains two novel terms capturing informality responses on an intensive and an extensive margin. Both terms decrease the optimal tax rates. We estimate the model with Colombian data and find that informality strongly reduces tax rates at all income levels. In particular, the possibility to migrate to entirely informal employment restricts tax rates at low and medium income levels, while the possibility of moonlighting is relevant at higher levels of earnings. We also show that the informal sector is welfare improving when the preferences for redistribution are weak and welfare deteriorating when the preferences for redistribution are strong. To explain this result, we demonstrate that the informal sector increases labor efficiency at the expense of possible redistribution.

<b>The Quantitative Importance of Technology and Demand Shocks for Unemployment Fluctuations in a Shopping Economy</b>

<div id="abstract-shopping-economy" style="display:none;">
  We construct and estimate a business cycle model with search and matching frictions in the labor market and in the product market. We show that the dynamic structure of the model and the endogenous job separation rate are important to accurately represent the empirical responses to the technology and the demand shocks. Our main finding is that the demand shock explains at least 58% of the unemployment fluctuations in the US, while the technology shock accounts for the residual.

<p><b>Optimal Income Taxation and Commitment on the Labor Market</b> 
<br>
Rej&R in <i>Journal of Economic Theory</i>

<div id="abstract-opt-tax-commitment" style="display:none;">
  The optimal income taxation literature typically assumes that labor is traded on the spot markets. I relax this assumption by equipping workers and firms with a commitment power and, as a consequence, allowing for more sophisticated labor contracts. The main finding is that when both workers and firms have any positive commitment power, the tax schedule cannot be too regressive, as otherwise wages would be inefficiently randomized to reduce the expected tax paid by workers. I also show that the insurance of workers depends only on the total commitment power on the labor market, but not on its division between workers and firms. I calibrate the model to the US income distribution. The threat of wage randomization reduces the optimal marginal tax rates at low income levels by up to 40 percentage points and in certain cases makes the optimal tax schedule fully linear.

<p><b>Optimal Taxation with Permanent Employment Contracts</b> <br>
<!-- [<u>job market paper</u>] -->
<a href="files/optimal_taxation_permanent_contracts.pdf">[paper]</a>
<a style="cursor:pointer;" onclick="return toggleMe('abstract-dual-labor-markets')">[abstract]</a>
<div id="abstract-dual-labor-markets" style="display:none;">
New Dynamic Public Finance describes the optimal income tax in the economy without private insurance opportunities. I extend this framework by introducing permanent employment contracts which facilitate insurance provision within firms. The optimal tax system becomes remarkably simple, as the government outsources most of the insurance provision to employers and focuses mainly on redistribution. When the government wants to redistribute to the poor, a dual labor market could be optimal. Less productive workers are hired on a fixed-term basis and are partially insured by the government, while the more productive ones enjoy the full insurance provided by the permanent employment. Such arrangement discourages the tax avoidance of the productive workers and hence allows the government to tax them more. I provide empirical evidence consistent with the theory and characterize the constrained efficient allocations for Italy.</div>

<b>Minimal Compensation and Incentives for Effort</b>
<p>
<a href="files/minimal_compensation.pdf">[paper]</a>
<a style="cursor:pointer;" onclick="return toggleMe('abstract-minimal-compensation')">[abstract]</a>
<div id="abstract-minimal-compensation" style="display:none;">
When does paying a strictly positive compensation in every state of the world improve incentives to exert effort? I show that in the typical model of moral hazard it happens only when the effort is a strict complement to consumption. If the cost of effort is monetary, a positive minimal compensation strengthens incentives only when the agent is prudent and always does so when the marginal utility of consumption is unbounded at zero consumption. I suggest applications of these results in the personal income taxation.
